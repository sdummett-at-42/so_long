# Welcome to so_long

> This project is a very small 2D game. I worked with textures, sprites, and some very basic gameplay elements.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sdummett/so_long.git && cd so_long && make so_long
```

## Usage
```sh
./so_long *.ber
```
All the maps are in the maps directory.
You can use your own map with a .ber extension

Have fun ! ðŸŽ®
